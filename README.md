# 📘 Stemming and Lemmatization – README

This project demonstrates the basic concepts of **Stemming** and **Lemmatization**, two important text preprocessing techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

* Explanation of stemming and how it reduces words to their root form
* Demonstration of common stemmers (Porter, Snowball, Lancaster)
* Explanation of lemmatization and how it returns valid dictionary words
* Comparison between stemming vs. lemmatization
* Python examples using **NLTK** and **spaCy**

## 🛠 Requirements

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install nltk spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the notebook:
   `Stemming_and_Lemmatization.ipynb`
2. Run each cell in order to see the output.
3. Modify the text samples to experiment with your own inputs.

## 📄 Output

* Shows processed tokens for both stemming and lemmatization
* Highlights differences in accuracy and structure

## 📚 Use Case

Useful for NLP tasks like:

* Text classification
* Chatbots
* Sentiment analysis
* Search engines
* Information retrieval
